Install Instructions
====================

WARNING: It's easy to lock yourself out of a box if you install this code
improperly. Make sure you generate your codes first and never close an SSH
connection to a box you don't have physical access to until you are sure
everything works.

Note: See http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/ if you have issues
building google-authenticator libpam code.

1. Build

Run `make` to pull in the submodules (google-authenticator), build its demo
application, and copy the demo application into the current root.

2. Install the Files

Running `make install` will drop ssh_gatekeeper.sh and
google-authenticator-demo into /usr/local/bin, and flip on their executable
bit.

3. Set Up SSH

*WARNING* This part could lock you out of the box, so if you are running these
commands on SSH make sure you do NOT log out until you have confirmed that the
installation worked.

To enable without scp/rsync, add this to your sshd_config:
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh_gatekeeper.sh

To enable with scp and rsync, add this to your sshd_config:
ForceCommand ALLOW_SCP_RSYNC=1 /usr/local/bin/ssh_gatekeeper.sh

Restart your ssh process.

4. Test

Log into your box with SSH. Make sure that it accepts the correct code, does
not accept incorrect codes, and that you cannot hit Ctrl+C to drop into a
shell.
