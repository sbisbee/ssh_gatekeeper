The original work on this script was done by Calomel.org and is hosted at
https://calomel.org/openssh.html under the Creative Commons

The script is being hosted here so that it's in a more developer friendly
medium, but also so that the following modifications could be made:

  - Run the google-authenticator's demo binary instead of asking a question. If
    the binary exits successfully, then let the user in.

  - Whether to allow rsync and scp, which doesn't work with 2 factor auth, is
    now configurable.
